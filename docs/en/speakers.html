Let us examine what are some of the myths surrounding out field and which aspects might actually be useful. Is SW engineering an art or just another skill? Is talent required? Does it even matter? What about the 10X engineer...?</p>

                                    Luke is 17 and is studying computer science, maths, further maths and physics in Year 12 (English Secondary school / Sixthform). He loves to program in Python and thinks that the micro:bit is a great eductional tool and should be more widely used. He has given previous talks at Pycon UK and is looking forward to speaking at Pycon SK 2019.

                                <p>Captivating a group of children for a sustained period of time is notoriously hard. I will be exporing with you how the micro:bit can be used to engage a young audience with interactive demos and programming activities.</p>
                                <p>Children love to physically interact with hardware. That is what is great about the micro:bit. It not only has built in LEDs and buttons but can also control bigger more exciting electronics like robotic arms. This allows for setup that gives students of all ability levels a challenge. Students that are beginners to programming can be given a more complete program or walk throught a worksheet that takes them through the process of controling the device (in this case a robotic arm) step by step. Students that have higher programming skills can be given a more bare bones / boilerplate source file and can write code to control the arm with less guidance.</p>

                                    Building for the modern web is complicated and error-prone: a typical web app requires five different languages and four or five frameworks just to get started. Wouldn't it be nicer if we could do it all in Python? With Anvil, you can design your page visually, write your browser-side and server-side code in pure Python, and even set up a built-in database in seconds. In this talk, Meredydd will walk us through how Anvil works under the bonnet, and the challenges of building a programming system that's easy to use without sacrificing power.

                                    Anvil is a platform for rapidly developing web apps using nothing but Python.

It's like Visual Basic for the web. It has a drag-and-drop editor for constructing a user interface, controlled by Python code in both the client and a hosted server environment.

This is an interactive workshop where you'll be guided through creating an app. Either:
* A TODO list - a simple example of a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) app
* A weather data dashboard
* An app that controls a remote machine from the web
* Any other idea you might have!

You'll need a laptop to follow along.

                                <p> On Jan 26th, the first meetup of the Bratislava Peer Python Learning Group series took place, and it was a blast. Do not take my word for it, read what attendees had to say: “At home, I go on Facebook or to the fridge. Here, it is a study atmosphere, and I am pulled to learn.” “There are people here, who explain to me where I went wrong. I would be frustrated and give up without them.” “I am looking forward to those Saturday community meetings.”</p>
                                <p> There is some magic going on in the Python Meetups the attendee statements of which you could read above. I give you a glimpse of why we at Progressbar founded the group, how the model of blended learning works, and what benefits had participants felt from stretching their computational thinking muscles. I will talk about the peer and community aspect of the course and describe the composition of the group. Finally, I outline the vision for these groups and give some tips for organizing such a group.</p>

It makes it essential to know how to test network interactions. It is particularly important for microservices - to connect them you need to do network calls.</p>
                                <p>This talk will walk from most straightforward ad-hoc solutions to more tunable and extensible ones. You’ll learn how to approach testing network on different isolation levels in sync and async code, take away ideas and practices how to use with popular Python tools like responses, pook, VCR, and pytest.</p>

                            <p>    I’m passionate cloud technology enthusiast. For the first time I came across clouds at University when I was choosing my master’s thesis. My route began with open-source Openstack. After studies, I’ve started working at Davinci software as cloud specialist where I gained most of my knowledge about Amazon web services (AWS). For last four years my daily routine is architecture, implementation, maintenance, deployments, automation… of infrastructure and applications from development to production environments. I’m a collector of various AWS certifications and hobby Python developer. From time to time you can meet me at University of Zilina where I lecture about cloud technologies. You can also meet me at Conservatory of Zilina with the guitar in my hand. </p>
                            <p>    If you want to know more about possibilities of Amazon web services or just want to casually talk about cloud technology don’t hesitate to stop me anytime and ask.

                            <p>    Alexa is Amazon’s cloud base voice service that provides natural voice experience to end users. This opens a way to use human voice as input/output for you applications. You can easily create voice-controlled applications (called Alexa skills) or just voice interface for your current products or anything you like! Tools provided by Amazon web services (AWS) are easy to use and if used correctly, then completely free. Once skill is done, it’s just a matter of minutes to deploy it as high-available, auto-scaled, serverless, globally distributed application using AWS. Then you can use Amazon Alexa Skill store to sell your product all over the world. I would like to show you how it works, what AWS provides to developers and how can anybody create Alexa skills using your favorite language – Python.

While correct working with datetime objects and offsets can be mastered, you have no control of the information on local time zones. Exclusive domain of geographers one hundred years ago, the time zones adjustments became a toy in the hands of governments all around the world. </p>
                                <p> After a short overview of Pythons datetime and pytz libraries you'll learn how the information on time zone changes gets into your system. We'll fly quickly around the world's over five hundred time zones, but will also focus on the case of Slovakia and surrounding countries. Two centuries of propaganda and chaos in thirty minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!</p>

                                <p> Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python “warts” are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.  This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.</p>

He does so by travelling to various conferences all around the globe. He graduated with a college degree in computer programming back in the last millennium. Apart for a little break to get his BSc in computational astrophysics, he has always been in the industry. As a technical evangelist with Auth0, he meets with developers to help them make the web a safer place. During his free time, he is usually found stargazing in a campsite somewhere or brewing a fresh batch of beer in his garage.

It seems like nowadays it can take weeks to start a project -- creating a signup form, a login form, a password recovery screen, and all the validation in between. And you haven't even started on security considerations yet. During this presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID Connect and OAuth. They will also learn how to leverage these technologies to create more secure applications. Most importantly, they will learn how to delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their real work and forget about all that security stuff.</p>

                                <p> Banka disponuje veľkým objemom neštruktúrovaných dát. Na ich použitie je potrebné tieto dáta očistiť. Preto vyvíjame modul na korekciu gramatických chýb a preklepov, ktorý sa skladá z troch hlavých častí. Prvou časťou je takzvaný "re-diakritizátor" zameraný na obnovenie diakritiky v slove bez nej. Druhá časť je znakový model SymSpell. Ten navrhuje možné opravy slova na základe Damerau-Levenshtein metriky. Tretia časť využíva známy model Word2Vec na pochopenie kontextuálnych závislostí slov v relevantnom dokumente. Vývoj modulu nie je ešte ukončený, avšak subjektívne posúdenie modulu indikuje použiteľnosť v špecifickom bankovom prostredí.</p>

                                <p> You probably spend too much time regretting that manual recurring routines don't do themselves. Let's change this! This workshop will empower you to automate all the things using GitHub Apps integration type as reusable restless workers helping you overcome typical maintainer frustrations. We'll have a walkthrough of the complete application creation and deployment process: from creating an App entity in the GitHub UI, to actual coding and to shipping your code via Heroku.
                                <p> To participate in the hands-on, bring your laptop with Python 3.7 and some editor on-board. You'll also need to have a GitHub account.

                                <p> How to lead a dev team with zero personal experience in people management while still having no idea how to manage even your own time. After several years of fairly regular software developer career path, I've found myself in a new role that I've unconsciously put myself into. Being a solid senior developer, management at the time agreed that I am a good candidate for the team lead. Being promoted to a new personal level of incompetence I felt lost and confused in my new role, but made a pact with myself to see this one through to the end. And so it came that for the past few years, I've been development team lead for several teams.</p>
                                <p> With zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random pieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me I've more or less successfully lead my teams to their goals. On that path, I've learned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams. I would like to share what worked and what didn't, my emotions, my regrets, and my wins. </p>

He has worked for a number of data-intensive start-ups, most recently working with Aneesh Chopra (the first CTO in the US government) building data systems that analyze billions of patients records and lead to highest savings for millions of patients, he started his work on scaling solutions using machine learning in early 2008 while working as first full time engineer at Couchsurfing where he helped grow the company from a few thousand users to a few million. Jorge had degrees in electrical engineering & computer science, including a masters degree in computer systems (with a focus on applied Machine Learning) from the Australian National University.

                                <p> We can't expect Machine Learning experts to be both domain experts across various fields and also true experts in ML, it is crucial to rethink how we build tools so that we can provide Machine Learning capabilities to experts in various disciplines that are not necessarily savvy in machine learning, but are experts in their own domains, so that they can too become participants of the data science community. </p>
                                <p> This talk is divided into three sections:</p>
                                <p> The first one, dives into the importance of democratizing Machine Learning, its objective is to demonstrate why now this is a crucial issue to be solved and to show the risks and problems that present themselves when Machine Learning Engineers take in the responsibility of building predictive technologies in domains that are not necessarily where they are the most experts on.</p>
                                <p> The second part of this talk focuses on some solutions and approaches to challenges of democratizing Machine Learning, as well as the journey and results we have seen at MindsDB while at this endeavor as well as what would be new ways that the ML community can think of the next generation of tools being built.</p>
                                <p> The third and most extensive section of this talk, focuses on the new issues that are born once machine Learning capabilities are on the hands of not ML experts, more importantly, the implications of delegating the Machine Learning machinery to a system, and what is important in order to trust those systems. Which leads to the importance in further developing our understanding of explainability, interpretability, and robustness of ML.</p>

                                <p> Myšlenka Steva Kruga "Nenuťte uživatele přemýšlet" bude hlavní inspirací pro příspěvek, který se bude věnovat pojmům jako je UX (user experience), UI (user interface) a použitelnost. Smyslem je poukázat na základní principy použitelnosti a návrhu uživatelského prožitku, které pomohou navrhovat a vytvářet intuitivní a pochopitelné služby či uživatelská rozhraní s cílem jít svým uživatelům naproti, tedy aby uživatelé museli dělat pouze nezbytné kroky s vynaložením co nejmenšího úsilí.</p>

                                <p> “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Well, Machine Learning can look like magic, but you don't need to be a data scientist or an ML researcher to develop with ML. </p>
                                <p> So, what about making your solution smarter without any knowledge in AI? With pre-trained models and a few lines of code, Machine Learning APIs can analyze your data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can now help in getting even more specific insights tailored to your needs. </p>
                                <p> In this session, you'll see how to transform or extract information from text, image, audio & video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an AutoML custom model, and you'll be an active player of a live demo. Don't put your smartphone in airplane mode!</p>

                                <p>
                                    I'm a Vienna based software developer and blockchain expert. With an academic background in the social sciences I have always been a programmer. Starting out as a self-taught programming enthusiast at age fifteen I built games and played with fun scripts until eventually I went on to become a software developer by profession. Built the blockchain interacting infrastructure in a fast growing start-up which I recently quit to start again in an early stage start-up which aims to bring industry data to the blockchain. Over my 15 years of writing code I have always been enthralled by the idea of open source and contributed to a number of projects.

                                <p> This talk is structured into two parts of approximately equal length:  </p>
                                <p> First an introduction to blockchains in general. Most have heard about blockchains or bitcoin but how does it actually work and what is the technology driving it? This talk will explain what a cryptocurrency wallet is, how transactions are created and how they are brought together to form blocks that build the blockchain. I will outline differences between the most widely used implementations and the core technological concepts behind them, like Proof-of-Work versus Proof-of-Stake, consensus algorithms, trustless systems and the ideas behind them.</p>
                                <p> In the second half of the talk I draw on my experience working with python in my professional career and give an overview of the python ecosystem for blockhain and cryptocurrency development. I will showcase some of the libraries and tools that exist, like btcpy and highlight some of the pros and cons (mostly pros) of using python in this sector.</p>
